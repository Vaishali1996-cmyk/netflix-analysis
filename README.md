Hello everyone,
While browsing Kaggle, I stumbled upon a Netflix genre dataset that, despite being limited and partially incomplete, piqued my interest. I saw it as a great opportunity to practice data storytelling and extract insights from 2006 to 2021.
🔧 I kicked off the project with data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, applying techniques like conditional formatting to ensure consistency and clarity in the dataset.
🧠 Next, I dove into data modeling and used DAX functions such as COUNTAX, SWITCH, SUM, and TOPN filters to build dynamic measures and create insightful visualizations.
📊 The result? A Power BI dashboard that uncovers trends in genres, country-wise content distribution, and content maturity levels across the Netflix platform over the years.
🎯 Key Takeaway: Even a limited dataset can tell a powerful story when paired with thoughtful modeling and visualization.
